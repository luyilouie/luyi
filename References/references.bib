   Abstract = {In the friction stir welding (FSW) process, heat is generated by friction between the tool and the workpiece. This heat flows into the workpiece as well as the tool. The amount of heat conducted into the workpiece determines the quality of the weld, residual stress and distortion of the workpiece. The amount of the heat that flows to the tool dictates the life of the tool and the capability of the tool for the joining process. In this paper we formulate the heat transfer of the FSW process into two boundary value problems (BVP)-a steady state BVP for the tool and a transient BVP for the workpiece. To quantify the physical values of the process the temperatures in the workpiece and the tool are measured during FSW. Using the measured transient temperature fields finite element numerical analyses were performed to determine the heat flux generated from the friction to the workpiece and the tool. Detailed temperature distributions in the workpiece and the tool are presented. Discussions relative to the FSW process are then given. In particular the results show that (1) the majority of the heat generated from the friction, i.e., about 95%, is transferred into the workpiece and only 5% flows into the tool and (2) the fraction of the rate of plastic work dissipated as heat is about 80%.},

   Note = {0921-5093},
   Abstract = {Steady-state friction stir welding of stainless steel has been modeled using an Eulerian formulation that considers coupled viscoplastic flow and heat transfer in the vicinity of the tool pin. Strain hardening is incorporated with a scalar state variable that evolves with deformation as material moves along streamlines of the flow field. The model equations are solved using the finite element method to determine the velocity field and temperature distribution, with a modified Petrov-Galerkin employed to stabilize the temperature distribution. The evolution equation for the state variable for strength is integrated along streamlines using an adaptive procedures to determine step size based on the element size. The intense shearing and associated heating lead to complex behavior near the tool pin. The effect of this complex response is demonstrated with the crystallographic texture, which displays a nonmonotonic strengthening and weakening history along streamlines that pass close to the tool pin.

The primary goal is to assist in the development of new welding tools, though the models also improve the understanding of the deformation mechanism in FSW, and enable a first order visualisation of the flow round the probe. The paper describes a quantitative method of comparing the flow round different tool shapes. A novel 'slip' model was developed, where the interface conditions were governed by the local shear stresses. This revealed significant differences in behaviour when compared with the common assumption of material stick. The two-dimensional model has demonstrated the viability of the approach for investigating the flow round practical tool shapes, and gives confidence that the development of more computer intensive three-dimensional models will be justified.},

Through the use of a novel slip model, a two-dimensional pin profile was optimised to minimise the traversing force. Two versions of a tool based on the optimised profile were developed: the plain 'Trivex' and the threaded 'MX-Trivex'. These were tested against one version of the 'MX-Triflute' tool that had comparable pin and shoulder diameters. Experiments showed that the traversing force was reduced by between 18 and 25% and the down force was reduced by approximately 12% when compared with the MX-Triflute tool. The different pin designs had little effect on the heat input and the tensile strengths of the welds were comparable. The development and validation of the full three-dimensional model for both the Trivex and Triflute tools is described in Part 2.},

Building on a two-dimensional model, and preliminary trials with a novel 'Trivex' tool design, discussed in the companion paper immediately before this one, a full three-dimensional model was developed. The model predicted the temperature, and the traversing and down forces, which were compared against experiments. The model incorporated a novel 'slip' boundary condition, based on that developed in two dimensions. A conventional 'Triflute' tool was modelled and compared with the new 'Trivex' tool design. The model correctly predicted that the Trivex tool had lower traversing and down forces than its Triflute counterpart. To assist understanding of the material flow, streamlines around each of the tools were plotted. Ultimately the technique could be used to size the pin features reducing the need for costly experiments.},

   Abstract = {It is widely recognised that the fundamental mechanisms associated with the weld formation process and their relationships with welding parameters are complex and remain to be fully understood. The present paper reports a series of general findings based on a set of simplified numerical models that were designed to elucidate various aspects of the complex thermomechanical phenomena associated with friction stir welding. The following phenomena were investigated in separate numerical models: (i) coupled friction heat generation; (ii) plastic flow slip zone development: and (iii) three-dimensional heat and material flow. The friction induced heat generation model was used to quantify the contributions of coupled thermomechanical friction heating, including non-linear interfacial phenomena between the tooling (e.g. stir pin) and material being welded. The plastic work induced heating effects were also examined. The plastic slip formation mechanisms were then investigated by considering contributions from various heating mechanisms. Finally, a simplified three-dimensional heat and material flow model, based on the observations from the coupled friction heat generation model, was used to establish some initial insight regarding the heat and material flow. The results,from the three subproblem areas were then generalised in the form of a simple parametric relationship between welding variables (i.e. travel and rotating speeds) and weld formation conditions. A series of assumptions were made in constructing these individual models since there exists little information on actual material behaviour under friction stir welding conditions. However, the findings from the present study not only illuminate some of the important weld formation mechanisms in friction stir welding, but also provide tin effective framework for more focused investigations into some of the fundamental phenomena identified in the three subproblem areas; such investigations will be reported separately in a future publication.},

The algorithm, which is implemented in MATLAB 5.2, is provided with a separate module for calculation of the microstructure evolution and the resulting hardness distribution. The process model is validated by comparison with in-situ thermocouple measurements and experimental hardness profiles measured at specific time intervals after welding to unravel the strength recovery during natural aging. Furthermore, the grain structure within the plastically deformed region of the as-welded materials has been characterized by means of the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) technique in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), Some practical applications of the process model are described toward the end of the article.},

spontaneous melting occurs this facilitates tool slippage at
the contact interface. Accurate stir zone temperature and

the strain rate using the Zener׈ollomon relation. In
Al 2024 and Al 7075 spot welds spontaneous melting of
second-phase particles produces a drastic reduction in strain
rate values. In Al 5754 and Al 6061 spot welds there is a
strong correlation between tool rotational speed and estimated
strain values. Local melted films dissolve rapidly in
the high temperature stir zone and when the spot weld cools
to room temperature following welding. Evidence of local
melting is observed in Al 7075 friction stir spot welded

The moving heat source engendered by the rotation and linear traverse of the pin tool has been correlated with the actual machine power input. This power, obtained from experimental investigation, has been distributed to the different interfaces formed between the tool and the weldpiece based on the torques generated at different tool surfaces. Temperature dependent properties of the weld material have been used for the finite element based numerical modelling. Good agreement between the simulated temperature profiles and experimental data has been demonstrated. The effects of various heat transfer conditions at the bottom surface of the workpiece, thermal contact conductances at the interface between the workpiece and backing plate and different backing plate materials on the thermal profile in the weld material have also been investigated numerically.

The equations of conservation of mass, momentum and energy were solved in three dimensions using spatially variable thermophysical properties using a methodology adapted from well established previous work in fusion welding. Non-Newtonian viscosity for the metal flow was calculated considering strain rate and temperature dependent flow stress. The computed profiles of strain rate and viscosity were examined in light of the existing literature on thermomechanical processing of alloys. The computed results showed significant viscoplastic flow near the tool surface, and convective transport of heat was found to be an important mechanism of heat transfer. The computed temperature and velocity fields demonstrated strongly 3D nature of the transport of heat and mass indicating the need for 3D calculations. The computed temperature profiles agreed well with the corresponding experimentally measured values. The non-Newtonian viscosity for FSW of stainless steel was found to be of the same order of magnitude as that for the FSW of aluminium. Like FSW of aluminium, the viscosity was found to be a strong function of both strain rate and temperature, while strain rate was found to be the most dominant factor. A small region of recirculating plasticised material was found to be present near the tool pin. The size of this region was larger near the shoulder and smaller further away from it. Streamlines around the pin were influenced by the presence of the rotating shoulder, especially at higher elevations. Stream lines indicated that material was transported mainly around the pin in the retreating side.},

   Abstract = {In this paper two models of the Friciton Stir Welding process will be discussed. The first is a thermal model which is used to simulate temperature profiles in friction stir welds. The required inputs for this model are total input power, tool geometry, thermo-physical properties of the material being welded (density, conductivity, specific heat) welding speed and boundary conditions. The output from the model can be used to rationalize observed hardness and microstructure distributions. The second model is a fully coupled, 2-D fluid mechanics based process model that is used to make parametric studies of variations in properties of the material to be welded (mechanical and thermophysical) and variations in welding parameters. Results from this model provide insight regarding the effect of material properties on friction stir weldability and on potential mechanisms of defect formation. Both models are readily implemented on a Windows or similar computing platform. Limitations and critical issues for extension of the models will be discussed.},

The material flow and heat generation are characterized by the contact conditions at the interface, and are described as sliding, sticking or partial sliding/sticking. Different mechanisms of heat generation are behind each contact condition, making this study important for further understanding of the real FSW process. The analytical expression for the heat generation is a modification of previous analytical models known from the literature and accounts for both conical surfaces and different contact conditions. Experimental results on plunge force and torque are used to determine the contact condition. The sliding condition yields a proportional relationship between the plunge force and heat generation. This is not demonstrated in the experiment, which suggests that the sticking contact condition is present at the tool/matrix interface.},

The heat flow close to the probe/matrix interface is investigated. In the models presented, the heat is forced to flow around the 'probe hole'. In this manner, the material flow through the probe region, which often characterises other thermal models of FSW, is avoided. This necessitates controlling the convective heat flow by prescribing the velocity field in the narrow shear layer at the tool/matrix interface. As a consequence the sliding, sticking, or partial sliding/ sticking condition can be modelled. Six cases are established, which are represented by three stages of refinement of the heat source model, combined with two different contact conditions, i.e. full sliding and full sticking.},

   Volume   = {13},
   Number   = {1},
   Pages    = {77-93},
   Abstract = {The conditions under which the deposition process in friction stir welding is successful are not fully understood. However, it is known that only under specific thermomechanical conditions does a weld formation occur. If these conditions are not present, void formation will occur leading to a faulty weld. The objective of the present work is to analyse the primary conditions under which the cavity behind the tool is filled. For this, a fully coupled thermornechanical three-dimensional FE model has been developed in ABAQUS/Explicit using the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation and the Johnson-Cook material law. The model accounts for the compressibility by including the elastic response of the aluminium matrix. The contact forces are modelled by Coulomb's Law of friction, making the contact condition highly solution dependent. Furthermore, separation between the workpiece and the tool is allowed. This is often neglected in other models. Once non-recoverable separation is estimated by the model, a void develops. This is suggested as a preliminary criterion for evaluating the success of the deposition process. Of special interest is the contact condition along the tool/matrix interface, which controls the efficiency of the deposition process. In most models presented previously in the literature, the material flow at the tool interface is prescribed as boundary conditions. In all other contact models, the material is forced to keep contact with the tool. Therefore, the models are unable to predict when the suitable thermornechanical conditions and welding parameters are present. In the present work, the quasi-stationary thermornechanical state in the workpiece is established by modelling the dwell and weld periods. The different thermornechanical states in the colder, stiffer far-field matrix and the hotter, softer near-field matrix (under the tool) result in contact at the tool/matrix interface, thus, no void formation is observed. The steady-state model results are compared to the plunge force and heat generation observed in experimental welds in AA2024-T3.},

   Abstract = {The properties of a workpiece joined by friction stir welding (FSW) are directly related to the material flow around the tool. In the present work, the material flow is investigated by traditional metallography as well as X-ray and computer tomography (CT). By introducing a thin copper strip in the workpiece and welding through it, thus, acting as a marker material, detailed information about the flow field is gathered. The two- and three-dimensional CT images are used in parallel with micrographs for visualization of the flow field. Two procedures for estimating the average velocities for material flowing through the shear layer are presented. The procedures depend on the configuration of marker material relative to the welding direction, i.e. longitudinal and transverse. As such, the present work constitutes the first attempt in the literature to estimate flow velocities in FSW based on thorough experimental investigations. (c) 2005 Acta Materialia Inc.

   Abstract = {A two-dimensional friction stir welding (FSW) process model has been developed. The fully coupled model is based on fluid mechanics and handles the solid state material transport during welding as a laminar, viscous flow of a non-Newtonian fluid past a rotating circular cylinder. The heat necessary for the material softening is generated by deformation of the material. Material flow visualisation experiments agree very well with the predicted flow field. Accordingly, material within the pin diameter is transported only in the rotation direction around the pin. Owing to the simplifying assumptions inherent in the two-dimensional model, other experimental data such as forces on the pin, torque, and weld energy cannot be directly used for validation. However, the two-dimensional model predicts many of the trends observed in the experiments. The model also predicts a deviation from the 'normal' material flow for certain combinations of welding parameters, suggesting a possible mechanism for the occurrence of some typical FSW defects.

Parametric studies have been conducted to determine the effect of tool speeds on plate temperatures and to validate the model predictions with available measurements. In addition, forces acting on the tool have been computed for various welding and rotational speeds. It is found that pin forces increase with increasing welding speeds, but the opposite effect is observed for increasing rotational speeds. Numerical models such as the one presented here will be useful in designing welding tools which will yield desired thermal gradients and avoid tool breakage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The finite element analysis code-WELDSIM, developed by the authors specifically for welding simulation, was used. Two welding cases with tool rotational speeds of 300 and 500 rpm are analyzed. The objective is to study the variation of transient temperature and residual stress in a friction stir welded plate of 304L stainless steel. Based on the experimental records of transient temperature at several specific locations during the friction stir welding process for the 304L stainless steel, an inverse analysis method for thermal numerical simulation is developed. After the transient temperature field is determined, the residual stresses in the welded plate are then calculated using a three-dimensional elastic-plastic thermo-mechanical simulation. The effect of fixture release after the welding on the residual stresses is also studied. Comparison with the residual stress fields measured by the neutron diffraction technique shows that the results from the present numerical simulation have good agreement with the test data.
